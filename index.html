                <p>
                   My name is Amr Moubacher, a graduate from UC Irvine's school of Public Health Science.
                   I am a small bussiness owner/operator of a Car Wash as well as a Valet company headquartered in Laguna
                   Beach California. I have 10+ years in the Car Washing industry and 6+ years in the Valet industry.
                   My goals are to effectively learn how to program and eventually become a software developer, in order to
                   expand on projects I would like to make for the different businesses. Furthermore, I would like to get a job
                   in software development to see how developers work together and see the different levels of coding
                   that there are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to reach these goals, I started to learn programming during the first Covid lockdowns in 2020. I took
                    a class online on a site called Udacity. There, I got an 'Intro to Programming' microdegree in which I learned the 
                    fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Python. Through that experience, I learned that different programming languages do are
                    just means to an end. I decided to take the Bootcamp offered at UCI in order to make a career change that will eventually 
                    help me gain experience working with developers and clients in order to make certain tasks easier, and add extra functionality 
                    to already existing elements in my work.
